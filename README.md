## About Scales Practice

Scales Practice is an app that will aid music students in preparing for their ABRSM examinations, or simply just students who want to practice their scales.  

A musician myself, I remember only too well the hassle of trying to practice all of my scales without forgetting any! I used to cut up lots of small pieces of paper and handwrite my scales onto each, then pick them from a jar.  

In order to build this project I used the ABRSM syllabus for Clarinet, Flute and Saxophone, and input all of the scale requirements into a MongoDB database.

Please note that it can take up to 30 seconds for the backend server to run, so you may need to refresh a few times...

## How to Use

Users should simply select their instrument (out of the following choices: Clarinet, Flute and Saxophone - I hope to add more in the future!) and grade, and a randomised scale will be picked for them to practice. I have included all of the relevant articulations for each level.

### To install dependencies:

`npm i`

### To start the project:

`npm start`
